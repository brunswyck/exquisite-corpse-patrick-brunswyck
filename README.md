> *Once upon a time* **2 rabbits** live in what is called a __**rabbithole**__..
> They knew a sly fox was roaming about the pastures so they held a meeting to discuss how to best defend their lands and prevent the sly slithering fox from entering their beloved rabbithole :D

> The meeting went on for ever with foxes sneaking up the rabbit hole. 
> Tensions was rising and instead of worrying about the sly foxes creeping in, most of them got furious at each other. 
> The rabbit with the red had threw a carrot at the white-socked rabbit.

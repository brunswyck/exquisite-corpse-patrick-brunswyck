## it goes like this

> *Once upon a time* **2 rabbits** live in what is called a __**rabbithole**__..
> They knew a sly fox was roaming about the pastures so they held a meeting to discuss how to best defend their lands and prevent the sly slithering fox from entering their beloved rabbithole :D

> The meeting went on for ever with foxes sneaking up the rabbit hole. 
> Tensions was rising and instead of worrying about the sly foxes creeping in, most of them got furious at each other. 
> The rabbit with the red had threw a carrot at the white-socked rabbit. 

>When the tension notch down, they decided to hire a group of well-trained armadillos to defend their hole.
>The task wouldn't be easy, since armadillos lived far away, in the hot dessert near El Paso.
>But first they had to distract the fox outside the door so one of them could sneak out and look for the help.

>The white-socked rabbit threw a carrot far from their hole. so, sly foxes will be distract from their hole.
>When foxes see a carrot comming from the hole and they are going to chatch it. so, they run after a carrot.
>When foxes distract outside the door then one of them sneak out and look for someone for help.
